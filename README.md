# Mathematical Calculator MCP Server

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides  advanced mathematical calculation capabilities, including symbolic math, statistical analysis, and matrix operations.

## Features

The Mathematical Calculator MCP Server provides the following tools:

- **Basic Calculations**: Evaluate mathematical expressions safely
- **Symbolic Mathematics**:
  - Solve equations (linear, quadratic, polynomial, etc.)
  - Calculate derivatives of expressions
  - Compute integrals of expressions
- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - Mean, median, mode
  - Variance, standard deviation
  - Correlation coefficient
  - Linear regression
  - Confidence intervals
- **Matrix Operations**:
  - Matrix addition
  - Matrix multiplication
  - Matrix transposition

## Installation
This server can be used with docker compose, Docker run, or with your container orchestration platform of choice.   This server has been modified to support Streamable HTTP MCP and use FastMCP 2.10 or greater.
